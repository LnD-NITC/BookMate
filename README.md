Book Mate is a comprehensive matchmaking and recommendation platform designed to connect readers based on their book preferences. Utilizing a powerful combination of modern web technologies, machine learning, and a user-friendly interface, Book Mate offers an engaging and efficient way to discover new books and like-minded readers.

## Features

### Matchmaking Algorithm
The core of Book Mate is its sophisticated matchmaking algorithm. When users opt-in for matchmaking, they take a quirky questionnaire that assesses their reading preferences. The system also takes into account the books added to their library. Once the countdown timer ends, the algorithm analyzes the quiz answers and library contents to match users with similar reading profiles.

</p>

### Quiz for Matches
The matchmaking process begins with a fun and interactive quiz. This quiz is designed to understand the user's reading habits, preferences, and personality. The answers provided here are crucial for the AI model to find the best possible matches.

### Library and Wishlist

Users can manage their personal library by adding their favorite books. The more books added, the more accurate the matchmaking results. Users can also create a wishlist for books they intend to read in the future. This feature enhances the matchmaking process by providing more data points for the AI model to consider.

### Recommendation System
Book Mate's recommendation feature allows users to search for a book and get curated suggestions based on their selection. The AI model, trained on over 1,149,000 ratings from over 278,000 users worldwide, ensures that the recommendations are relevant and tailored to the user's tastes. Users can also get random book suggestions if they are unsure what to read next.
